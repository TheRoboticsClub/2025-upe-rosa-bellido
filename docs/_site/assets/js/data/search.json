    "content": "First week landing on project UniboticsThis first week I’ve started from the basics following the documentation provided by my peers to deploy the webserver locally as to get used to its architecture, directories, database and overall functionality due to the many new technologies I’m working with for the first time. From WSL2, which was the hardest part starting with a clean copy and was only necessary because my OS is Windows 10, to the easy to get used to Docker.On relation to this, working from Windows 10 allowed me to try to recreate problems external Windows users were having with the official public platform, though unsuccessfully since I wasn’t met with those same issues.  Refer to the about tab for a small description on what the Unibotics project entitles and is about!"
