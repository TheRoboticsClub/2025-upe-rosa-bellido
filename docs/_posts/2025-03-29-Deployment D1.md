# First week landing on project Unibotics

This first week I've started from the basics following the documentation provided by my peers to deploy the webserver locally as to get used to its architecture, directories, database and overall functionality due to the many new technologies I'm working with for the first time. From WSL2, which was the hardest part starting with a clean copy and was only necessary because my OS is Windows 10, to Docker, which was easy to get used to both as an user through the official website and from a developer's standpoint deploying the server locally. Though running into these issues was frustrasting it helped us realize the need to update the documentation regarding the adjustments necesary for a newbie working on an OS other than Linux.

On relation to this, working from Windows 10 allowed me to try to recreate problems external Windows users were having with the official public platform, though unsuccessfully since I wasn't met with those same issues under the same circumstances.
